Variational algorithms are characterized by the use of a classical optimization algorithm to iteratively update a parameterized trial solution, or \"ansatz\". Chief among these methods is the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) that aims to solve for the ground state of a given Hamiltonian represented as a linear combination of Pauli terms, with an ansatz circuit where the number of parameters to optimize over is polynomial in the number of qubits.
