1a:T4dd,Quantum computers provide a tool to look at these problems in a different way. Scientists continue to experiment with better algorithms to apply to these problems. In anticipation of commercial quantum computing, leading companies are identifying and testing use cases that generate in-house quantum capabilities. The more effectively designed a use case is, the more likely it will be to deliver business value. Take, for example, the use case of untangling operational disruption in airline schedules and staffing. This use case shows promise because it has the potential to offer a disruptive solution for a core business problem in the future; there is an existing, though sub-optimal, classical alternative; and quantum algorithms have already been shown to be effective in choosing the best scenarios in Monte Carlo simulations used in banking and finance. Strategic use cases such as this one attend to near-term technical feasibility; consider the potential for quantum computing technology to outperform classical alternatives; and assess the projected business impact, as determined by market outcomes, competitive consequences, and financial impact. For some key business problems, even a slight advantage can have significant impact.1b:T40f,The automotive industry could potentially benefit from quantum computing in a variety of areas such as new battery design and development, software verification and validation, factory automation, quality control, and advanced driver assistance. Daimler Mercedes-Benz, used quantum computing for optimizing transportation logistics and chemistry of vehicle batteries. Ben Boeser, innovation director for the company’s North American R&D unit, says that developing and perfecting more energy-dense battery technologies could “unlock a billion-dollar opportunity.” Simulating all the various molecular properties and behaviors is beyond the current computing power of even today’s supercomputers. Quantum computing offers a potential way to speed up the simulation process. Boeser notes that “the multiyear process of testing and validating new battery technology could translate into missed opportunities in the market if this work is delayed,” which is why Daimler Mercedez-Benz worked with IBM Quantum to harness the power of 2:["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-[1fr,auto] relative","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"min-h-app
